# Blackstone Keep

## 1. Overview

Perched atop jagged northern cliffs, Blackstone Keep has defended the realm for over three centuries. Commissioned by Queen Elara Stormborn after the Dragon Wars, its black-granite walls are said to be enchanted against fire.

## 2. Construction & Architecture

- **Built:** 1425 A.D., by order of Queen Elara Stormborn
- **Materials:** Solid black granite quarried from nearby Blightrock Ridge
- **Grand Hall:** Vaulted ceiling with murals of the Siege of Wyrewell and the Pact of Truce
- **Defenses:** Four corner towers, curtain walls fifteen feet thick, a deep dry moat

## 3. Notable Events

- **1623 – The Moonlit Betrayal:** Lord Cassian’s coup attempt; he and his knights were slain in the Grand Hall under moonlight.

## 4. Folklore

- On stormy nights you can hear phantom trumpets echoing through the keep—believed to be the war-horns of a lost battalion.

## 5. Present Day

Though the royal court has moved to Sunreach Palace, Blackstone remains grim and unyielding. Knights still patrol its ramparts by torchlight, ever watchful against threats from the Frostfang Pass.
